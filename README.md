Hello! Welcome to LC Computer Science 2025

This github repositary is for me to be able to share large files with you without having to take screenshots (which is proving impractical)

Hopefully this link works - the idea is that you have saved solutions to some of the exercises we do in class. 

Course Outline:
30% coursework project
70% exam - split between a practical Python Coding exam and a written theory exam

4 ALTs to be completed throughout the 2 year course
